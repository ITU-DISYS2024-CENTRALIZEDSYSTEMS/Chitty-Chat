\subsection*{Discuss, whether you are going to use server-side streaming, client-side streaming, or bidirectional streaming?}
\subsection*{Describe your system architecture - do you have a server-client architecture, peer-to-peer, or something else?}
We have implemented our Chitty-Chat program throught the server-client architecture. 
This means that a server is launched and is only responsible for the communication between different clients. This means that the clients are only responsible for
sending acceptable data from the client to the server.
\subsection*{Describe what  RPC methods are implemented, of what type, and what messages types are used for communication}
\subsection*{Describe how you have implemented the calculation of the Lamport timestamps}
\subsection*{Provide a diagram, that traces a sequence of RPC calls together with the Lamport timestamps, that corresponds to a chosen sequence of interactions: Client X joins, Client X Publishes, ..., Client X leaves. Include documentation (system logs) in your appendix.}
Server   - Starting
Client 1 - Joined the conversation
Client 2 - Joined the conversation
Client 1 - Sends a message
Client 2 - Leaves the conversation
\subsection*{Provide a link to a Git repo with your source code in the report}
\subsection*{Include system logs, that document the requirements are met, in the appendix of your report}
\subsection*{Include a readme.md file that describes how to run your program.}
